This inspection detects outdated versions of declared dependencies in Maven POM files, Gradle Kotlin DSL files, and SBT build definitions.
It can help you maintain your project's dependencies at their latest stable versions for better compatibility, performance, and updates.
<p>
    The inspection works by checking the declared version of each dependency in your project's build configuration files against the latest versions available in public repositories. If it identifies a newer version, the inspection will raise a warning and suggest an update. This not only ensures your project is up-to-date, but also aids in identifying potential security and compatibility risks associated with outdated dependencies.
